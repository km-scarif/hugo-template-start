title:  Repo 2

This is a README with an imbedded image

If you want the image to be rendered in the page in a Hugo site, and do not want to move the 
image to `static/` you will need to name the page `index.md` instead of README.md.  The name of 
`index.md` turns the directory into a "branch bundle" and assets in the directory can be linked 
directly
